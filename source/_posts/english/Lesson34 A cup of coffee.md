## 句型
1、 Do you like coffee? Yes,I do.

like (v.) 喜欢

具体解析： 
a. 喜欢、愿意
- I like reading in bed.
- I like to eat it.
注意： 当使用like doing sth.时是指经常习惯的动作；而like to do sth.则指想要/将要做某事。

- I like dancing.
- I like to dance with you.

b.同义词辨析：
- love
 - love 爱（比like的情感更加强烈）
 - I love to swim with you.
- enjoy (欣赏/享受，同时具有一种满足感)
 - I enjoy Luo dayou's songs.
 - I enjoy listening to music.
 - 注意： 若enjoy后面是一个动词，需要用该动词的ing形式，这个是固定用法
 - I enjoy eating cakes.
- be fond of (对……感兴趣，而且这个兴趣一时半会儿不会消退)
 - I am fond of Ship.
 - She is fond of samll cats.
 - You are fond of buying new shoes.

c. 彼此相像的（一般做表语） 其反义词为unlike
 - The twin sisters are very like/unlike

注意： 做动词表示喜欢，愿意时，反义词为 dislike,如果时形容词表示彼此相像的，反义词为 unlike

d. 作为介词，可以指“像……一样”
This boy is dancing like a monkey.

2、 want 在句子里的用法

- Do you want a cup?
