## 单词解析

1、 o'clock adv. 点钟

本词一般放在数字1至12的后面，表示“点钟"
如果是上午的“点钟”,再加上a.m.
如果是下午的，则再加上p.m.

- ‘The Voice' starts at 8 o'clock p.m.
 、
 凌晨 00:00 后面是 0 a.m. 午间 12:00 后面是跟 12 p.m

 2、 moment n.时刻

相关用法：
moment = a very short time
一会儿/片刻
比如： Can you waite a moment?

相关词组：

at the moment = now

- She is on holiday at the moment.

## 经典句型

询问时间：

- What is the time ? = What's the time?

- What time is it now?

- Could you tell me the time?

- What time is it by your watch/clock?

- It is about 3 a.m.

- It is 2:12 p.m.

英语中，逢“半点”的时候，要用half来配合表达。中文里表达时间时，当分针“过了”几分钟，我们会说： 七点过五分，八点过二十。在英文里，“过”这个介词就是“past”。

- 八点三十分， It is half past eight.

**请注意顺序** 分针在前，past,时针在后。

- 七点零五分， It is five past seven.
- 三点零二分， 2 past 3
- 四点十六分 16 past 4
- 五点二十分 20 past 5
- 六点十分 10 past 6
